# PicoBroker

## Overview

A small MQTT and MQTT-SN port of IBM's Really Small Message Broker (RSMB).

*This is a work in progress*

### Notes

- using Espressif's ESP-IDF build system and components
- using Platform.io for build (this project should open in Platform.io and all depencencies install)

- RSMB is componentised in ./components/rsmb

## Build

You should be able to build, flash and monitor using Platform.io tools or ESP-IDP idf.py

## Licensing

As RSMB is under Eclipse Public License - v 1.0 this project currently is too.
